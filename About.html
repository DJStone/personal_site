                <p>Dear Future Employer,<br> 
                    I would like to express my gratitude for your interest in having myself as a part of your amazing organization.<br>
                    Over the course of my working career, I have used my aptitude in problem solving and organizational skills in order to lead my teams on the path to success. While working at various points along the supply chain, from receiving to distribution, I have had the privilege to see how every gear turns to understand the inner workings of how the industry works. And with the knowledge I gained I have acquired the skill to optimize how tasks are completed in order to increase efficiency across the entire system.<br>                    
                    In order to reliably reach any goals, I have developed a wide set of interpersonal skills to facilitate and maintain a functional team including but not limited to effective communication, flexibility and dependability.<br>
                    As your future employee I would like to congratulate you on the wonderful investment you have made to your company and encourage you to look forward to the high returns you will be receiving.<br>
